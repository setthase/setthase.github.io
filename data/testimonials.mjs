He is a JavaScript expert in the full sense of the word, often taking on extremely tough programming challenges, where most others would fail. Not surprisingly, he has played a pivotal role in developing the front-end of a SaaS reporting solution for Beyond Analysis, using the latest and greatest JavaScript has to offer. 

Tomasz has been excellent at interpreting my functional specifications and is a breeze to work with, Anybody would be VERY lucky to have him on their team roster.`,
